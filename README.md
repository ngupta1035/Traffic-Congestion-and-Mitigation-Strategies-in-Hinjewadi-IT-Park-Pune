# 🚦 Traffic Congestion Detection and Mitigation Strategies – Hinjawadi IT Park

## 📌 Project Overview
Traffic congestion is a major issue in rapidly growing urban IT hubs such as **Hinjawadi IT Park, Pune**, where a high volume of vehicles during peak hours leads to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and air pollution. Traditional traffic management systems rely on manual monitoring and fixed signal timings, which are inefficient in handling real-time traffic dynamics.

This project presents an **AI-based traffic congestion detection system** that uses **computer vision and deep learning** techniques to analyze traffic conditions from **CCTV camera video feeds**. The system detects and counts vehicles in real time using the **YOLO object detection model** and classifies congestion levels into **Low, Medium, and High**. The results are visualized using an interactive dashboard to assist traffic authorities in traffic monitoring and decision-making.
